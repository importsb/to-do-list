# to-do-list(wip)
A Python command line todo list app. It supports adding, removing, listing, and marking tasks as complete. I built this to practice and learn Python basics(loops, dicts, functions, and cli flow).

## features
- Add single and/or multiple tasks
- View tasks in a formatted table
- Remove tasks via ID
- Mark tasks as complete
- Keeps consistent task IDs during session

## requirements
- Python 3.x
(No third party libraries used)
